Welcome to the **Single-Cell Omics Research and Education Club**!

If this is your time to the club, **I want to extend and extra-special welcome to you!**

I'm **Jonathan Nelson**, an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California. I'm a **wet** scientist turned **wet+dry** scientist. I've been working with **single-cell RNAseq data** for the past **5 years** and I'm excited to share what I've learned with you.

## SCORE Values

### **Learning**
We believe that bioinformatics is a constantly evolving field, and that ongoing learning and professional development is essential to staying up-to-date. We encourage members to share their knowledge and experiences with each other, and to seek out opportunities for continued learning.

### **Accessibility**
We believe that access to bioinformatics support should be available to everyone. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where all members can feel comfortable asking for help and contributing to the group.

### **Collaboration**
We believe that working together is key to achieving success in bioinformatics. We value the diversity of perspectives and backgrounds that each member brings, and we encourage open communication and the sharing of ideas.

### **Integrity**
We believe in conducting ourselves with honesty and professionalism in all our interactions. We hold ourselves to high ethical standards and respect the privacy and confidentiality of all members.

### **Empathy**
We believe in approaching each other with empathy and kindness. We understand that bioinformatics can be a challenging and sometimes frustrating field, and we strive to support each other through these difficulties.

## Context and Expectations

I know a lot of this has been going on in the background for everyeone and I wanted to bring it to the forefront. **My expectation** is that we have **about 6 of these meetings** together and then we can re-evaluate if we want to continue as a group or not.

Today's code (**this html file**) will be posted to the SCORE website (https://usckrc.github.io/website/score.html)
